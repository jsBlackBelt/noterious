_**Provide a short, unique and descriptive directive prefix such as acmeSalesCustomerInfo which would be declared in HTML as acme-sales-customer-info.**_

Why?: The unique short prefix identifies the directive's context and origin. For example a prefix of cc- may indicate
 that the directive is part of a CodeCamper app while acme- may indicate a directive for the Acme company. Don't use 
 a feature as a prefix, better to use company abbreviations.

> Note: Avoid ng- as these are reserved for Angular directives. Research widely used directives to avoid naming conflicts,
 such as ion- for the Ionic Framework.
